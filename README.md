# Amazon_Dashboard

I have made an interactive dashboard using tableau, extracting meaningful insights from the dashboard. This project involves various bar graph, donut chart, trend lines, map by revenue etc. I have also used filters to find out top 5 states as per the revenue. Some key insights-
1. Although Amazon heavily relies on merchants for providing goods to their customer bur share of Amazon products are very high in comparison to merchants. (Amazon- approx. 72%)
2. Among different categories, sets are in high demand and its share is 51%.
3. The ratio of shipped to unshipped is very impressing as Amazon has only 6% orders are unshipped.
4. Among all the states Maharashtahas highest revenue. (More than 12million).
